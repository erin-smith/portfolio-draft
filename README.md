# portfolio
A portfolio made with React showcasing my latest work (September 2020), resume, and contact info with a SendGrid API.

This React Portfolio includes work from my recent projects, updated contact information, resume and working links to reach me through many methods, including a SendGrid API for email! It utilizes React-Router, Components, axios, and dynamic rendering.  

The About page includes a Bio and links in the header and footer (LinkedIn, Instagram, Github).

The Portfolio page includes 9 of my current favorite projects with links and printable PDF of my resume. The flip tiles are rendered using screenshots from each actual project.  The tiles include clickable buttons to both the Github Repo and live sites.

The portfolio contains a Full-Stack app for Achilles heel, Skip-to-the-Loo, Purple Pages ( media streaming guide), Schedule Planner, Current Resume page, Burger app, a Timed JavaScript Quiz, Team Generator,  and a Virus Video Game! I've included a React-Router and Mobile-Responsiveness fixes.
