        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Greetings! I hail from Tulsa, Oklahoma- the heart of "Tornado Alley".</p><p>I grew up playing: <span
            className="font-italic">Myst, Sim City, Lemmings, Carmen San Diego, Glider,</span> and <span className="font-italic">Monkey
            Island</span>.
          I love languages: coding, math, music, literature/writing, and art.
          My obsessions with puzzles, problem-solving, and helping other people drive me.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Full-Stack Web Developer for hire, I enjoy JavaScript, jQuery, ES6, React, Node, Express, API's, JSON, AJAX, MySQL, MongoDB, Git, and Heroku.  I'm adept at HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, and other CSS frameworks. I am passionate about bringing life-enhancing ideas to fruition through code and collaborating with others to do so.  There is always more to come- I am a life-long learner!</p>
        <p> Profession: I have 15 decorated years of experience managing restaurants and caf√©s. I build inspired,
          loyal, sustainable teams. I put people first.   </p> <p>
          Optimistic about finding a new career- in the Tech world, I hope to work my way up from a full stack web developer and one day
          combine my skill-sets: Leadership in Tech.</p><p>
          I am hopeful, hard-working, and driven.
